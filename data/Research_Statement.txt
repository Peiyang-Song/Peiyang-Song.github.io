My research interest is in Machine Learning (ML), from its applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), to its foundations in Systems and Programming Languages (PL). My recent research works are mainly in two directions: 1) neuro-symbolic reasoning and AI4Math combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs); 2) energy-efficient machine learning with temporal logic.
